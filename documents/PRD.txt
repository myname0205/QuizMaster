Product Requirements Document: "QuizMaster AI" (MVP)1. Executive SummaryProduct Name: QuizMaster AI (Working Title)Vision: To democratize engaging education by allowing anyone to create high-quality, gamified assessments in seconds using Generative AI, while providing real-time competitive environments for learners.MVP Goal: Launch a functional web-based platform where teachers can generate quizzes (manually or via AI), students can join via code, and real-time results are tracked.2. User PersonasPersonaRoleKey NeedsPain PointsThe Host (Teacher)Admin/CreatorFast content creation, reliable hosting, actionable data.Creating multiple-choice questions takes too long; grading is tedious.The Player (Student)ParticipantEasy entry, engaging UI, instant feedback.Registration barriers; boring interfaces; lagging games.3. Functional Requirements (MVP Scope)3.1 Authentication & User ManagementTeacher/Host:Sign up/Login via Email & Password and Google OAuth.Dashboard view to manage quiz sets and past reports.Student/Player:No account required (Guest Mode).Join via "Game PIN" or "Room Code."Enter a temporary nickname and select an avatar.3.2 Quiz Creation & ManagementThis is the core differentiator. The system supports two modes of creation.A. Manual CreationHost adds questions one by one.Input fields: Question Text, Image Media (optional), Time Limit (e.g., 30s, 60s), 4 Answer Options (select correct one).B. AI Auto-GenerationTopic-to-Quiz: Host types a topic (e.g., "Photosynthesis," "French Revolution").Text-to-Quiz: Host pastes a block of text (up to 2,000 words).Output: The system generates a 5-10 question set with distractors (wrong answers) automatically. Host can edit/delete questions before saving.3.3 Game Lobby & Real-Time LogicGame Code Generation: Unique 6-digit alphanumeric code generated upon "Start Game."Waiting Room: Real-time list of students appearing as they join.Host Controls: Ability to kick inappropriate nicknames; "Start Game" button.3.4 Gameplay (The Arena)Teacher View: Displays the current question, a timer, and a live counter of how many students have answered.Student View: Displays the question and answer buttons (color-coded).Synchronization:All devices must sync. When the teacher moves to the next question, student screens update immediately.Scoring: Points awarded for Accuracy + Speed (like Kahoot/Quizizz).Leaderboard: Displayed between questions (Top 5 players).3.5 Post-Game AnalyticsPodium: Visual celebration of top 3 players.Summary Report (Host View):Overall Class Accuracy (%)."Toughest Question" (Question with the lowest accuracy).Downloadable CSV/PDF of results.4. User Flow DiagramsTeacher JourneyLogin $\rightarrow$ Dashboard $\rightarrow$ Create Quiz (AI or Manual).Save Quiz $\rightarrow$ Library.Select Quiz $\rightarrow$ Host Live $\rightarrow$ Lobby (Code Generated).Start Game $\rightarrow$ Question Loop $\rightarrow$ Final Leaderboard.Student JourneyLanding Page $\rightarrow$ Enter Code.Enter Nickname $\rightarrow$ Waiting Room.Answer Questions (Loop) $\rightarrow$ View Final Rank.5. Technical Requirements5.1 Technology Stack (Recommendation)Frontend: React.js or Next.js (for fast, interactive UI).Backend: Node.js with Express.Real-time Engine: Socket.io or Firebase Realtime Database (Critical for syncing teacher/student screens).Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (to store user profiles and question sets).AI Integration: OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini or GPT-3.5 Turbo for cost efficiency) or Google Gemini API.5.2 AI Prompt Engineering LogicThe backend must send structured prompts to the LLM to ensure JSON output.Example Prompt: "Generate 5 multiple choice questions about [TOPIC]. Return response in JSON format with fields: question, options (array), correct_answer_index."6. Non-Functional RequirementsLatency: The delay between a teacher clicking "Next Question" and the student seeing it must be under 500ms.Scalability: The MVP should support at least 50 concurrent players in a single game room without crashing.Security:Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS (especially in nicknames).Secure storage of teacher passwords (hashing).7. Success Metrics (KPIs)Game Completion Rate: % of games started that reach the final leaderboard.AI Usage: % of quizzes created using AI vs. Manual.Retention: % of teachers who host a second game within 7 days.
